# Driver-Drowsiness
It is designed to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by driver drowsiness. The system employs computer vision techniques to monitor the driver's eyes in real-time, detecting instances where the eyes are closed for a predefined duration. If drowsiness is detected, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver.
